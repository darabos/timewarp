Single player melee between two fleets.

Player and enemy fleets are defined in the ini file. Set -1 there to choose a random fleet from the available possibilities. If you define a new fleet, don't forget to set the values of Nships and Nalliances.

You can toggle certain options. Currently the keys are hard-coded to:

Extra1	choose next ship in your fleet
Extra2	choose prev ship in your fleet
(these extra 1/2 keys are defined in the config menu for player 0)


A	fleet display
S	show stats while S is pressed
D	healthbars
F	ship panel
R	radar mode
R+left shift = relocate radar (left/mid/right) on the screen
L	choose different radar layouts (you can add new data files till gflmelee99.dat).

Use the target keys to select prev/ next/ closest target.

Stats about victims are only kept to a maximum of 32 kills per ship, and for a maximum of 128 different ships.


FAQ.

This game requires lots of memory, around 100 MB, because it loads so many ships. Naturally, the game will crash if you don't have this amount of memory.
