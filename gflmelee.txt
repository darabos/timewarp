Single player melee between two fleets.

Player and enemy fleets are defined in the ini file. Set -1 there to choose a random fleet from the available possibilities. If you define a new fleet, don't forget to set the values of Nships and Nalliances.

You can toggle certain options. Currently the keys are hard-coded to:

C,V	choose next ship in your fleet
A	fleet display
S	show stats while S is pressed
D	healthbars
F	ship panel
R	radar mode
R+left shift = relocate radar (left/mid/right) on the screen

Use the target keys to select prev/ next/ closest target.

Stats about victims are only kept to a maximum of 32 kills per ship, and for a maximum of 128 different ships.
