0.  What is Gob?
Gob is like a cross between Asteroids, Life-Force, and Star Control.
It uses the same data files as TimeWarp.  

1.  How do I start Gob?
Run twwin.exe or twdos.exe or twlinux or twbeos or whatever.
Click on the "Extended Menu" button.  Click on the "Gob" button.  

2.  What is the goal of Gob?
Avoid dieing.  
Try to get as bad-ass a ship as you can.  
Kill lots of enemies.
If you survive for long enough and accumulate enough wealth, you will
eventually be able to purchase the "Hyper Dynamo" upgrade.  Once you
get that, you can basically consider yourself to have won the game.
Try to win Gob with as many different ships as you can.  

3.  What are the controls in Gob?
The keyboard controls for config 0 in TimeWarp

4.  What can I do in Gob?
You can fly around in a really big map (MUCH larger than a normal melee).
You can kill enemy ships.  They appear randomly.
You can visit space stations.  They orbit planets.

5.  What can I do at space stations?
You can buy upgrades for your ship.
You can buy a new ship.  You automatically sell your old ship when you do
        so.
You can repair your ship.

6.  What starbases are there?  What are the differences between them?
There are 4 starbases of 4 types (though there are only 3 different
starbase graphics... the 4th uses a duplicate of one of the other threes
graphics, chosen at random).
They are located at random locations, except for one which starts out next 
        to you, at 12000x12000.
Each type of starbase sells a specific type of ship, either Supox, Orz,
        Kohr-Ah, or Utwig.
Some starbases may also sell unique upgrades only available there.  

7.  What upgrades are available.

There are a number of generic upgrades that are available for most
types of ships.  

Each purchasable ship type has a number of ship specific upgrades
available for it, including at least one special ship specific upgrade.  
Most special ship specific upgrades can only be purchased once.

There are also a number of very special upgrades.  These can
usually be purchased for any ship type, but only at certain
starbases.  Most of these are very expensive.  Some can only be
purchased when certain conditions are met.  

Most upgrades are lost when your ship is sold (although they add
to the sale value of your ship).  

These upgrades are available for all ships:

Crewpod                 Increases your max. crew by 4.  You cannot exceed 42.  
Battery                 Increases your max. battery by 8.  You cannot exceed
                        42.
Thruster Upgrade        Increases your max. speed by a lot, and your
                        acceleration by a little.  
Control Jet Upgrade     Increases your turn rate by a lot, and your
                        acceleration by a little.

These upgrades are available for Supoxi only:

Glob Former Upgrade     Increase the damage your gun inflicts by 1, and the
                        battery you require to shoot by a lot.  Don't buy
                        this a second time unless you have tons of dynamos
                        (5-8), and don't buy it a third time unless you have
                        gazzillions of dynamos (12-21).

These upgrades are available for Orz only:

                        space marines.

                        upgrade can only be purchased once.  

These upgrades are available for Utwig only:

Bolt Regulator          Increase maximum range

9.  What is the difficulty of the enemies based upon?  And the cost of the
upgrades?

The type and frequency of enemy spawning is based upon the time you have
been alive and the number of enemies currently alive.  The cost of the
upgrades is based upon what upgrades you already have, and upon what type
of ship you have.
