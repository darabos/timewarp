<h1>Timewarp Readme</h1>

<h2>Overview: What is Star Control: Timewarp?</h2>

<p>
Star Control TimeWarp is an open source clone/sequel to the epic
cross-genre game Star Control II.  Currently it includes only a combat
portion, although there are some plans to expand it to include an epic
adventure.  The plot of such an adventure would not have anything to do
with the name "TimeWarp".
</p>

<p>
Star Control: Timewarp is often affectionately called TW, and also goes by the
names TWMelee and AllegroTW.
</p>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>This release of Star Control: TimeWarp is public domain, to the
maximum extent possible considering portions of it are derivative
works of Star Control 1, 2, and 3.

Long Credits:

The Creators
        Fred Ford
        Paul Reiche III
These two wrote Star Control II, which inspired Star Control: TimeWarp.

The Programmers
        orz
        The Fly (founder of the project) (inactive)
        Launchpad
        S.P.Y.
        Marcos (inactive)
        Mr. Sparkle (inactive)
        Richardyzo
        Alstar
orz (that's me) is currently managing the project.  I've written a lot of
  the code, and I integrate other peoples code when they send it to me.  
The Fly did most of the code up until version 0.05, when he joined the
  (Israeli) military (and started a music band?). 
Launchpad wrote all of the Star Control 3 ships, many of the TimeWarp
  original ships, and much of the WussieBot AI. 
S.P.Y. wrote SpyAI, the old gamma correction, the old options menu, and
  some bug-fixes.  
Marcos wrote the smoothing zooming code.  
Mr. Sparkle wrote some bugfixes and some portability stuff.
Richardyzo wrote the Zekfahan (sp?) Shocker.  
Alstar wrote the original Terran Destroyer, though it's been modified since
  by myself and Launchpad.  

The Artists (graphics):
        Launchpad

Unknown: Pkunk, Yehat, Kohr-Ah
Stolen from SC2: all other SC1 & SC2 ship panels
Alstar: Narool, Virtao, Terran, Kahr, Kterbi
Starfox: Phylxan

Gob:
The 1st (Supox) Gob station image was done by Drink_Pepsi
The other two (Orz, Kohr-Ah) were done by Gueest

The Artists (sound & music):
        People I don't know about (inactive)
        Alex Parker
        Launchpad
        Reddish
Um, Launchpad did the sound effects for most of the SC3 & original ships?  
Alex Parker the wrote title screen music for TW.  
Reddish did the victory song for Phylxan.  

The Web Page Managers:
        Atarex
        The Grand Fot
        Starfox
        Alstar
Atarex manages The Pages of Now & Forever, on which TimeWarps web page is
  hosted.  He used to also manage TimeWarps web page.  
The Grand Fot now manages TimeWarps web page.  
I think that Starfox also manages TimeWarps web page?  
Alstar wrote the descriptions of the original ships in TimeWarp that appear
  on the web page.  

The Documentation writters:
        orz
        Launchpad

orz (that's me again) wrote almost all of the .txt files... like this one.  
Launchpad wrote newship.txt, a guide to writting new ships, and wussie.txt, 
  which documents the WussieBot somewhat.  
The old readme (readme.old) was written by Ultron Debugger & The Fly

===< ChangeLog >===

Version 0.05 new features:
  * All 25 Star Control 1 and 2 ships are implemented in this version, fully
    functional, 3D rendered, with a few quirks here and there... (see
    bugs.txt)
  * Fleet selection has been integrated, and all the fleets which come with
    Star Control 2 have been incorporated, in addition to a new fleet
    consisting of all 25 ships. (allships.scf)
  * F11 allows to save in-game action screen shots, stored in the ScrShots
    directory
  * Not all ship data files need be present in order for the game to work
    (though at least one ship data file is required for the game to operate,
    and any records of the missing ships when loading a fleet with ships
    under their ID will be lost)
  * Amusing anecdote about Star Control 3 (intro) has been removed
  * Oh, yeah! Almost forgot... I bet no one gives a damn anyway, but full
    source code (with practically non-existent commenting) has been included.

Version 0.04 new features:
  * The following ships are implemented in this version, fully functional, 3D
    rendered, with a few quirks here and there... (see bugs.txt)
    + Pkunk Fury
    + Spathi Eluder
    + Utwig Jugger
    + Earthling Cruiser
    + Druuge Mauler
    + Yehat Terminator
    + Arilou Skiff
    + Chenjesu Broodhome
    + Slylandro Probe
    + Vux Intruder
  * Ship phase-in animation added
  * Default shot explosion sprite added, with custom shot explosion
    implemented for Druuge Missile and Chenjesu Crystal
  * Asteroid animation and planet sprites previously ripped have been
    replaced with original renders
  * An intro explaining the existence of Star Control clone projects such as
    this one, with music and text written by The Fly
  * An interface for selecting ships, with a now updated and built-in
    bronze-age technology user-hostile advanced keyboard setup section, and
    music written by Ultron Debugger
  * Support for 8-bit color and 15-bit color modes, as well as 16-bit color.
    Animation doesn't seem to be any smoother in 8-bit color mode...
    Oh, well... at least it looks ugly.
  * Implemented scp.ini file to keep keyboard settings, color mode, intro
    playing and music playing settings
  * F1 key mutes and unmutes music during melee
  * Random number generation has been fixed to actually give different
    numbers each time the program runs... WOW!
  * Project development is back at full pace, as long as The Fly doesn't
    suddenly get transfered to a combat unit and accidentally points his M-16
    at himself when it's loaded...

Version 0.03 new features:
  * New ship graphics, supporting 64 angles (previously 16)
  * Pkunk weapon shots added (yes, you can actually KILL your opponent!)
  * Only two players now, since this version is playable. Four player option
    will be available in following versions, once network support is achieved
  * Since project development may be frozen for a month, we decided to release
    a playable version quickly before the time it might come to a temporary
    halt. So we only had time to make Pkunk ships fully functional
  * The two Pkunk ships are colored differently for each player
  * Automatic zooming, continuos space, and mid-point focus have been
    implemented
  * 16-bit color graphics. This version's animation may not be as smooth on
    slower computers. In following versions we will implement support also
    for 8-bit color graphics, which will look slightly less attractive, but
    animation will be smoother with it
  * Added stone-age technology keyboard configuration utility

Version 0.02 new features:
  * 3D stars (Thanks to Fred Ford)
  * Asteroids
  * Collision (planet, ships, asteroids)
  * Animated panels
    + Crew & Batt stats
    + Batt light, when battery is low
    + Captain animation (IT'S ALIVE!)
    + Screen off animation at death
  * New .MOD (music) library JGMOD
    (will probably prevent crashes caused by the the MikAlleg library used
    in version 0.01)
  * Improved sound effects
    + Pkunk weapon shots and profanities included
    + Arilou weapon fixed
    + Ship and asteroid collision with planet SFX
  * Ship switching using F1-F4 keys
  * Ship and asteroid explosions
  * Victory is possible
    + when one ship stays, while others have been blown up by crashing at
      the planet)
    + victory music played for ship remaining...

...the writers of this document get nostalgic at this point, weeping and
wiping our noses on our sleeves. Therefore, we must stop writing to clean
them.
