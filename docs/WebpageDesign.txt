Nice to Have:

H1: RSS feeds for news items.

H2: RSS feeds for new posts in the forums

H1: Switch to another forum.  PHPBB is looking pretty good.  Consolidate all the other forums related to TW to this one new forum.  Preseve all content in the process.  Other forums include: Channel 44, http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~starcontrol/boards/timewarp/, all the team-specific boards.  

H3. If needed by specific teams, groups can be set up, and permissions set up for each group such that, for example, only Team Beige members can access the Team Beige forum.
