<h1>Development</h1>

This document describes some of the issues concerning contributing to Timewarp.

<h2>How to become and Timewarp Developer</h2>
<pre>

We're always on the lookout for new blood.

"Ahh... fresh meat for my ever-growing army of the undead!"
"Mr. Burns, you have to let go of the intercom button."
"Son of a bi-"

What sort of experience do you have?  Have you worked on a big project before?
What kind of work do you want to do on this project, is there any type of
technology you want experience with?

The normal algorithm is:
* read the forums Channel 44 (here) and here, also see here

* learn the codebase as well as you can, probably by making disposable changes 
to things like the ships

* keep your local version up-to-date via CVS (note that you won't have
permission to write to it yet, and you might have to deal with merging files if
someone's working on the same thing you are)

* when you feel you've learned the codebase well enough, make a small change to
the code, like a bug-fix, zip up the affected files, and send them to youBastrd!
or someone else who pretends they know what they're doing

* if you post enough good bug-fixes and make enough good suggestions in the
forums, you might be given developer access to CVS (write access)

<h2>A guide to a few of the wierder issues with programming for TimeWarp.</h2>
<pre>
Separation of Physics & Rendering:

Rendering functions (things like SpaceObject::animate()) are NOT allowed
to do any physics.  Not even a little bit.  This means that they are not
allowed to change any values in any SpaceObjects.  Of convenience sake,
animate_predict() does change some things, but it changes them back right
afterwards.  If you don't do this, networking will break.

Random Number Generation:

On the same topic, there are two random number generators used by TW;
the libc one, rand(), and a custom one, random().  Use random() when doing
physics, rand() when doing other things.  The reason for this is that
random() is synchronized in network games; rand() is not.  Using rand()
for something that's synchronized will desynchronize the game; and using
random() for something that's not synchronized can desynchronize the game.
Note: there is now a method of Control called rand(), which calls the
normal ::rand() or ::random() as appropriate, so you should use that one
for AI logic.
If you don't understand this, try this rule of thumb: always use random()
unless you're in a method named animate or in a Control.
Additional Notes: random() returns a random number over the range of all
non-negative integer values.  random(7) is equivalent to (random()%7) in
that it returns an integer from 0 to 6 inclusive.  random(7) is faster than
(random()%7).  However, there are some subtleties to passing arguments to
random().  random(7.0) returns a real number X such that 0 <= X < 7.
random(-7.0) returns a real number X such that 0 >= X > -7.  random(-7)
will return gobbly-gook: random() should not be called with a negative
integer.  random(-3, 5) returns a real number from X such that -3 <= X < 5.
random(Vector2(3,1)) returns a random vector V such that 0 <= V.x < 3 and
0 <= V.y < 1.  You don't get all these convienient helpers when calling
::rand() or Control::rand().  
Final Note: actually, there is now third random number generator included
in TW, called fs_random(), but you probably don't need to know about that
one, and it might get removed sometime.  

Trivial Conventions:

It would be nice if the following conventions were followed in TW code:
1.  The proper indentation amount is 1 tab.  If you don't like that (or if
your editor produces spaces when you hit tab), then try 2 spaces instead.
If you don't like that either, AT LEAST BE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT IN YOUR
INDENTATION POLICY!  YES, THIS MEANS YOU!!!
2.  In the same vein, do not use an editor that transparently replaces N
spaces with the "equivalent" tabs.  Or, if you must do so, make sure that
your indentation amount exactly matches the tab size.  Otherwise your
indentation will apear totally fucked up on other editors with different tab
sizes.  And don't use an editor that replaces tabs with spaces either.  
2.  Don't exceed DOSes 8.3 file name length limits.  Also, don't use strange
characters in file names.  To be specific, the 26 english characters and
underscores and up to one period per file name are okay.  I guess numbers
would be ok too.  Use lower case letters, never upper case.  
3.  Don't name two source files exactly the same thing, even if they're in 
different directories.  RHIDE doesn't like that.  
4.  All source files should have extensions of either .cpp or .h .  No .c or
.cc files.  Exception: .c files are permitted in the util directory.  
5.  The following code is incorrect
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) blah();
instead, do this
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) blah();
Why?  Because Visual C and gcc will scope i in different ways in the first
example, potentially causing issues when switching compilers.  

Collisions:

If you want to know whether or not you can collide with something, call 
int canCollide(SpaceLocation *other) and other->canCollide(this).  Things 
can only collide if BOTH return non-zero.  
If you want to change what you can collide with you can either override 
canCollide or you can modify the member variables collide_flag_ally and 
collide_flag_anyone.  If you override canCollide, never return true, always 
return either false or a base class' canCollide(other).  

Messages:

There is a global variable called message.  This allows you to display
messages at the top of the screen during gameplay.  Use it like this:
message.out ("Hello World!");
// prints "Hello World!" for 1 second in pallete color 15 (white)
message.out ("Hello World!", 4500);
// prints "Hello World!" for 4500 milliseconds in pallete color 15 (white)
message.out ("Hello World", 4500, 9);
// prints "Hello World!" for 4500 milliseconds in pallete color 9 (light blue).
message.print (4500, 9, 0, "Hello World (number %d, string %s)", 99, "cheese");
// prints "Hello World (number 99, string cheese)" for 4500 milliseconds in pallete color 9
This stuff behaves somewhat differently if you use it before a game is 
started or while the game is paused.  
Oh, and you have to include mview.h (or melee/mview.h or ../melee/mview.h)
to do this.

Reporting Errors:

If you wish to report an error condition, you can say something like:
tw_error("Oh no! an error occured!");
//simple error message
tw_error("This error was brought to you by the letter %c and the number %d", 'g', 3);
//error message using more complex printf-style stuff
When you report an error in this manner, a box will pop up and tell
the user your message, and the source file and line number from which
tw_error() was called.  The user will be presented with a number of buttons,
like "Abort", "Retry", and "Debug".  The "Abort" button will cause the game
to abort and dump the user back at the main menu.  The "Retry" button will
cause the tw_error() call to return as if nothing happened.  The "Debug"
button will attempt to stop the program in a debugger friendly manner so
that you can see the exact circumstances in which the error occured if you
have a good debugger installed.
Warning: Due to the funky way in which tw_error is implemented, it can
behave incorrectly in certain unusual circumstances.  If you seem to be
getting a compile or run-time error on a line with a call to tw_error(),
try surround it with curly brackets, like this:
        {tw_error("My error message");}
Update: there is now also an "Ignore" button, which causes future error
messages to be suppressed.  

TW also keeps a log of certain events for debugging reason.  It's not
recommended, but you can add your own events to that log.  Simply call
debug_log() with printf-style parameters and your stuff will be added.
The log is written to tw_sys.log.  The log is used very sparingly in TW.  

Query:

Query is an interface for finding items based upon position & layer.  You
call Query::begin( item, layers, radius) and it will search for items that
match these criteria:
1.  within radius of item (measured from center of gravity for objects, from
beginning for lines)
2.  within a layer specified by layers (using the same format as
collide_flag_anyone and collide_flag_ally)
3.  not item itself
At that point, Query::current will contain the first item found, or NULL
if none were found.  If you are sure that Query returned only objects, you
can refer to Query::currento instead, or if you're sure it returned only
lines, refer to Query::currentl.  Call Query::next() when you want to find
the next item.  Query searches intelligently by location (i.e. it is fast 
if there are few objects in the region you are searching).
Note: there are now some additional types of queries available that don't
require that the search center around an item...
Update: now a Query2 is also available, which uses attributes instead of
layers.  Eventually Query will be phased out in favor of Query2, at which
time Query2 will be renamed to Query.  I'll document how to use Query2
later...

Controls:

There is a class called Control, which is commented in melee/mcontrol.h.
This class should be used by all things that control ships: keyboards,
joysticks, AIs, etc..  It is intended to allow AIs to monitor any important
events like which ships are added to the game.  

Layers:

(note: layers will be removed from the code eventually, and replaced by
attributes...)
Each item (SpaceObject or SpaceLine) in TimeWarp is in a layer.  The layer
also helps determine what things an object can collide with.  Some of the
layers are:
LAYER_SHOTS       (for non-laser weapons, do NOT assume type Shot))
LAYER_LINES       (for lasers/lines.  you may assume type SpaceLine)
LAYER_SHIPS       (for ships, do NOT assume type Ship)
LAYER_EXPLOSIONS  (for explosions)
LAYER_CBODIES     (for cellestial bodies, i.e. asteroids and planets)
LAYER_HOTSPOTS    (for hotspots)
There are a number of things that deal with sets of layers.  For instance,
an item L can only collide with allies that are in layers that are in the
the set L.collide_flag_ally.  There is a similiar set, collide_flag_anyone
used for non-allies.  (Ally in this sense means things associated with the
same Control).  Additionally, Querys (described above) search for items in
sets of layers.  These are ways to describe the sets of layers:
ALL_LAYERS        every normal layer
OBJECT_LAYERS     every layer that contains only SpaceObjects
LINE_LAYERS       every layer that contains only SpaceLines
bit(L)            only the layer L
0                 no layers
Additionally, given two sets of layers, S1 and S2, 
int S3 = S1 | S2      S3 is all layers that are in either S1 or S2 (or both)
int S3 = S1 & S2      S3 is those layers in S1 that are also in S2
int S3 = S1 &~S2      S3 is those layers in S1 that are not in S2
Sorry if this stuff is a bit complicated... 

NOTE: Layers no longer determine the rendering order (which things are 
drawn on top when to items overlap).  Now that is determined by depth
void SpaceLocation::set_depth ( double d)
and
double SpaceLocation::get_depth()
Standard depths include:
DEPTH_STARS     (yes, you can draw things under the starfield if you want to)
DEPTH_HOTSPOTS
DEPTH_LINES
DEPTH_SHOTS
DEPTH_SHIPS
DEPTH_EXPLOSIONS
DEPTH_PRESENCE

Attributes:

Currently, attributes are rather incomplete.  But eventually Query will
be modified to replace the layers parameter with an attributes parameter.  
You can determine whether an object is derived from a common base-class
in the engine by checking it's attributes.  In addition, the following
attributes are defined at the moment:
ATTRIB_SYNCHED        describes the objects role in a network game
ATTRIB_INGAME         should generally be true
ATTRIB_TARGET         true if the item is a valid target
ATTRIB_FOCUS          true if the item is a camera focus (this attribute is not synched in network games)
ATTRIB_STANDARD_INDEX if true then SpaceObject::calculate will set sprite_index
ATTRIB_STRICT_RECT    if true then the item should only draw within its rectangle


Units used in TW

For many things, TW uses 2 different kinds of units - external units and
internal units.  Internal units are used in physics calculations and
everything else in-game.  External units are used in .ini files for
configuration purposes.  Units are converted when they are read from .ini
files.  Here is a list of unit types, their internal representations, 
external representations, and conversions.  

Time: internally milliseconds, externally SC2-time-units.
int ms = scale_frames(sc2_time);
Warning: the conversion is non-linear and rather weird.
Note: Many .ini files use milliseconds externally instead of SC2-time-units

Angle: internally Radians, externally Degrees.
double radians = degrees * ANGLE_RATIO;

Turning-rate: internally radians / millisecond, externally
SC2-turning-units.
double turning = scale_turning(sc2_turning);
Warning: the conversion is non-linear and rather weird.

Distance: internally game-pixels, externally range-units.
double game_pixels = scale_range(range_units);

Velocity: internally game-pixels per millisecond, externally
SC2-velocity-units.
double vel = scale_velocity ( ext_veloc );

Acceleration: internally game-pixels per millisecond per millisecond,
externally... for most things it's in SC2-velocity-units per SC2-frames,
but for ships it's in a combination of an SC2-velocity-units # and an
SC2-time-units #.  It's kinda funky, but that's the format of the data
we ripped from SC2 data files.
double accel = scale_acceleration( sc2_vel_units_per_sc2_frame );
double ship_accel = scale_acceleration ( sc2_vel_units, sc2_time_units);
Warning: If SC2-time-units are used then the conversion is non-linear and
weird.

Class derivation tree for game objects:

Presence (mframe.cpp)                                      //any item in the game
        SpaceLocation (mframe.cpp)                         //any item in the game that has a location
                SpaceObject                                //any item with a sprite (only SpaceObjects can bounce)
                        Animation (manim.cpp)              //an item that doesn't interact with things, just is there for graphics, to display a little animation
                                FixedAnimation             //the same as above, but this stays on top of something even as it moves around
                        Shot (mshot.cpp)                   //a bullet with a range
                                AnimatedShot               //a shot that uses a sequence of images over time
                                Missile                    //a shot that uses an image depending upon which angle it's pointing
                                        HomingMissile      //a missile that turns towards its target
                        Ship (mship.cpp)                   //exactly what is sounds like
                        Planet (mcbodies.cpp)              //exactly what is sounds like
                        Asteroid                           //exactly what is sounds like
                SpaceLine (mframe.cpp)                     //an item that appears as a line.  these can only collide with SpaceObjects, but not other lines.  
                        Laser (mshot.cpp)

<h2>How to hack Star Control: TimeWarp</h2>
<pre>
1     Hacking the Ship configs:

	In the ships directory there are 25 (or more) shp?????.dat files,
and an equal number of ?????.ini files, one of each sort of files for each
ship, with the first three ?s matching the first three letters of a species
name, and the next two matching that species ship class.  For examples,
Chmmr Avatars use the files shpchmav.dat and chmav.ini.  Don't touch the
.dat files, it's harder to change them and easier to screw things up when
changing them.  Use your favorite text editor (for instance, edit or
notepad) on the .ini files.  Inside there will be a bunch of lines like
"Damage = 2", organized into sections like "[Weapon]".  You can change the
stuff on the right hand side of the "="s, and ships in the game will change
properties!  Neato.
	(If you really want to change the .dat files, you can, but a text
editor alone won't work, you'll need to use the Allegro grabber first)

2     Compiling TimeWarp:

	You've edited the ships .ini files, but that's not enough.  You want
to hack directly at the source.  How do you start?  
	Well first you need a C++ compiler and Allegro.  If you don't
already have a compiler then we recommend DJGPP, a free DOS C++ compiler,
closely related to the standard GNU/linux compiler gcc.  tw05u5 has also
been shown to compile with Micro$oft Visual C++ (version 6.0) and ordinary
gcc (version 2.95 on linux).
        A detailed step-by-step walk-through of downloading & installing
everything necessary to build a DOS version of TimeWarp using DJGPP is
included in the file "djgpp.txt".
        The windows executables distributed with most TimeWarp versions are
compiled using Visual C++.  If you can't afford VC++, and wish to make a
windows version, it might also be possible with Borlands free compiler or
with MingW.  MingW and DJGPP are related to gcc.  

3     The Source Code:

        Read code.txt if you are planning on submitting code for use in the TimeWarp project.  

        The rest of the information in this file may be out of date.  

        The code is object oriented C++.  Any method named calculate() is 
probably called once per frame of physics, while any method named animate() 
is probably called once per frame of graphics.  Text search (ts.exe) or a
similiar utility (grep) can be very helpfull when editing SCTW; you frequently 
need to findwhat file something is defined in, and without an IDE that does 
that for you things can get difficult.  


	games/gsample.cpp is thouroughly documented.  Read it for a
description of how to write new game types for TimeWarp, and as an
introduction to TimeWarps style of doing things.
	The code for all the ships can be found in the various ships
directories (sc1ships, sc2ships, sc3ships, newships).  None of the
ships are commented, but since there are so many you can frequently
find a ship doing exactly what you want to do.
	Many of the header files (.h files) are partially documented.
Read them for information on how to interact with the various components
of TimeWarp.  In particular, read melee/mframe.h, as it contains the
most important stuff.

<h2>A guide to making new ships for Star Control: TimeWarp</h2>
<pre>
(this is a little out of date...)
(also, there's another guide to writting ships at this address:
http://www.richardyzo.hpg.com.br/timewarp/tutorial/index.html )

Sorry this took so long to get done but I deleted it once by mistake.
To do this properly one must have good C++ understanding, if you don't,
well don't even try this.

STEP 1: INSTALLATION

To start out you need a compiler for C++, my suggestion are VC++ if you want
to do a windows build, and have it.  If you don't I suggest DJGPP, because if
it works in that it will work in VC++.  Since I don't have VC++ this FAQ will
only explain it from DJGPP standpoint.  The first this to do is to install
DJGPP, get rhide editor with it.  Install it using the install instruction.
Don't forget to include your PATH and ENV lines in you config.sys.

Next you will need the following package to go with the compiler.  Allegro
(get the latest beta version) AASTR, and JGMOD.  Goto to the DJGPP site and
there should be links to all.  For AASTR and JGMOD no assembly required.
Just put in your DJGPP directory and go.  For Allegro though you will have
to build it.  Just run the makefile include with it and it will handle the
rest.  You should get some sample programs with it.  Go ahead and try them
out.

(more detailed installation instructions for DJGPP, Allegro, and related
packages are included in the file djgpp.txt)

STEP 2: PACKAGING

Now, you have to make a perimalary version of Star Control Melee,  First
create a project in RHIDE.  Add all the .cpp files to this,  make sure you
have all of them and no .h or other files.  Then make sure to include the .h
directories in the include line under the directory pull down.  This include
directories for allegro,JGmod,and AASTR.  Also make sure to include -lalleg
in the library windows.  At this point it should compile.  (Hopefully)

STEP 3: DESIGN

Now comes the fun part, figure out what you want to do with your ship.  One
thing is to remeber the constrants of the code.  Try not to do anything to
wild to start out.  Think about the current ships already in timewarp and
look at their code.  See what you like, what is hard and what is easy.  For
the most basic ship type of ship see the terran destroyer or the earthling
crusier.  Experiment with the current ships.  Get to know the code etc.  One
thing to note thought is due to the fact that some ships where made at
different times look at several examples.  Take for example the collisions.
You can allow turn off collisons using a flag for types of collison or edit
the canCollide function.  Thus look at many example to find the best way of
doing things.

STEP 4: CODING

Like every program (or fragment thereof) you eventually have to come down to
out it into code.  So if you don't know how to program in C++, go learn
because you've hit the end of the road, else keep reading.  First thing you
should do is rip the starting code from another ship...  This will give you
a skeleton to work from.  It should contain the ship class and one or more
weapons.  Below is a listing of functions that one could use and what each
contains:

calculate  Returns void

This is used for anthing that need constant updating.  Make sure you class
the parent of this class because it control the batt recharge, the ship
sprite, the weapon and special recharge, ship controls, hotspots, and
gravity.  In older version you would update by one but in the newer there is
a delay that you should add called frame_time It will be between 1 and 50 ms.

animate  Returns void
This function draws the current frame.

handle_damage  Returns void

This calculates fuel sapage, speed loss, damage (stuff that has to go
through sheild etc), direct damage (stuff that hits no mater what), and
repairs.

calculate_(five controls) returns void

This checks to see if you can use these controls.  The fire and special
checks recharge rate and energy usage.

activate_weapon (special) returns int

This actual creates the weapon and returns the true or false.

can_Collide Return int

Send you a pointer then you find out wither you can hit it.  Return a true
or false.  There is also a flags that can be set to determine classes that
can hit our not.


This list is not complete but should give you most of the function you will
need.  Look in mship.cpp and mcbodies.cpp for the rest and other details.
Now lets look at weapon, there are five types of weapons in SCTW.  They are:

Laser :Straight line for a certain time.

Shot : sprite weapon with only one frame.

Animate Shot : sprite weapon with multi frames.  Changes frame after time
delay.

Missle : sprite weapon with multi frames.  Changes frame using facing
direction.

HomingMissle : simular to missle except homes (DUH)

With all of these items the most important functions are calculate, animate, 
can_Collide, and handle_damage.  Also when you create a weapon, don't forget
to include in the spaceFrame otherwise it won't be updated.

Step 5 : DEBUGGING

This is your last step, the only piece of advise is that if it crashes to
the DOS prompt, I find that it is usually caused by incorrectly accessing
the sprites in the .dat file.  Hope this helps, and have fun.

<pre>
In theory, allegrotw should compile just about anywhere Allegro compiles.
In theory anyway.

                        post-pended on structd (non-standard but works on
                        most compilers))

instruction set         any (only IA32 tested)

OS portable             yes

Required Libraries      Allegro 4

Recommended Libraries   JGMOD

endian portable         yes (only little-endian tested)
