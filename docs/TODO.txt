Revision history:
2003.08.10 youBastrd! created because he's too lazy to go make a buzilla thingy on sourceforge or elsewhere
----------------------------------------------------------

This is a temporary file to keep track of what the developers of this project intend to do in the near future.
(view with wordwrap on)

Put stuff at the top of the list to indicated a higher priority.  Push completed items below uncompleted ones.

Task # is just some arbitrary number, started at a high number to make it look like we've been busy (in case we get confused about which bug we're talking about over email/AIM).  

Status types are: unassigned, assigned, done, lazy (no one wants to do it anytime soon).  

Expected completetion values are: ?? (unknown, for unassigned tasks), an actual date, a release version (let's call the next one 0.06), future (meaning we'll get to it, just not right now).
