<h1>Game Types</h1>

<h3>Gob</h3>
<pre>
0.  What is Gob?
Gob is like a cross between Asteroids, Life-Force, and Star Control.
It uses the same data files as TimeWarp.  

1.  How do I start Gob?
Run twwin.exe or twdos.exe or twlinux or twbeos or whatever.
Click on the "Extended Menu" button.  Click on the "Gob" button.  

2.  What is the goal of Gob?
Avoid dieing.  
Try to get as bad-ass a ship as you can.  
Kill lots of enemies.
If you survive for long enough and accumulate enough wealth, you will
eventually be able to purchase the "Hyper Dynamo" upgrade.  Once you
get that, you can basically consider yourself to have won the game.
Try to win Gob with as many different ships as you can.  

3.  What are the controls in Gob?
The keyboard controls for config 0 in TimeWarp

4.  What can I do in Gob?
You can fly around in a really big map (MUCH larger than a normal melee).
You can kill enemy ships.  They appear randomly.
You can visit space stations.  They orbit planets.

5.  What can I do at space stations?
You can buy upgrades for your ship.
You can buy a new ship.  You automatically sell your old ship when you do
        so.
You can repair your ship.

6.  What starbases are there?  What are the differences between them?
There are 4 starbases of 4 types (though there are only 3 different
starbase graphics... the 4th uses a duplicate of one of the other threes
graphics, chosen at random).
They are located at random locations, except for one which starts out next 
        to you, at 12000x12000.
Each type of starbase sells a specific type of ship, either Supox, Orz,
        Kohr-Ah, or Utwig.
Some starbases may also sell unique upgrades only available there.  

7.  What upgrades are available.

There are a number of generic upgrades that are available for most
types of ships.  

Each purchasable ship type has a number of ship specific upgrades
available for it, including at least one special ship specific upgrade.  
Most special ship specific upgrades can only be purchased once.

There are also a number of very special upgrades.  These can
usually be purchased for any ship type, but only at certain
starbases.  Most of these are very expensive.  Some can only be
purchased when certain conditions are met.  

Most upgrades are lost when your ship is sold (although they add
to the sale value of your ship).  

These upgrades are available for all ships:

Crewpod                 Increases your max. crew by 4.  You cannot exceed 42.  
Battery                 Increases your max. battery by 8.  You cannot exceed
                        42.
Thruster Upgrade        Increases your max. speed by a lot, and your
                        acceleration by a little.  
Control Jet Upgrade     Increases your turn rate by a lot, and your
                        acceleration by a little.  
Dynamo                  Increases your battery recovery rate.  

These upgrades are available for Supoxi only:

Glob Hurler Upgrade     Increase your max range by a medium amount, and your
                        projectile velocity by a little.  
Glob Former Upgrade     Increase the damage your gun inflicts by 1, and the
                        battery you require to shoot by a lot.  Don't buy
                        this a second time unless you have tons of dynamos
                        (5-8), and don't buy it a third time unless you have
                        gazzillions of dynamos (12-21).
BLADE Upgrade           ???

These upgrades are available for Orz only:

Missile Upgrade         Improves your missiles, both range and damage.  It
                        also makes them cost more battery to shoot.  
Marine Armor Upgrade    Improves the max. speed and acceleration of your
                        space marines.  
Absoption               ???

These upgrades are available for Kohr-Ah only:

Shuriken Sharpness      Increases damage inflicted by blades.  
Shuriken Speed          Increases the velocity of blades.  
FRIED Range             Increases the range & velocity of F.R.I.E.D.  This
                        upgrade can only be purchased once.  
FRIED Damage            Increases the damage dealt by F.R.I.E.D.  This
                        upgrade can only be purchased once.  

These upgrades are available for Utwig only:

Bolt Regulator          Increase maximum range
Bolt Charger            Increase damage inflicted.  Also slows your
                        rate of fire.
Bolt Generator          Speeds up your rate of fire
Mask of Honest Demeanor        ???
Mask of Elephantine Fortitude  ???
        (note that you are only allowed to purchase one mask)

These very special upgrades may be available.  Some will be hidden,
some will not be available, some may not be available until certain
conditions are met.  Most are extremely valuable.  

Planet Locator                 Keeps you from getting lost.
Divine Favor                   ???
External Defense System        ???

9.  What is the difficulty of the enemies based upon?  And the cost of the
upgrades?

The type and frequency of enemy spawning is based upon the time you have
been alive and the number of enemies currently alive.  The cost of the
upgrades is based upon what upgrades you already have, and upon what type
of ship you have.

10.  What's a good score in Gob?

11.  Why is Gob so addictive?  
</pre>

<h3>gflmelee</h3>
<pre>
Single player melee between two fleets.

Player and enemy fleets are defined in the ini file. Set -1 there to choose a random fleet from the available possibilities. If you define a new fleet, don't forget to set the values of Nships and Nalliances.

You can toggle certain options. Currently the keys are hard-coded to:

C,V	choose next ship in your fleet
A	fleet display
S	show stats while S is pressed
D	healthbars
F	ship panel
R	radar mode
R+left shift = relocate radar (left/mid/right) on the screen

Use the target keys to select prev/ next/ closest target.

Stats about victims are only kept to a maximum of 32 kills per ship, and for a maximum of 128 different ships.
</pre>


<h3>Vanguard</h3>
<pre>
 Presently Vanguard (VG) is just a "Hunt down the enemy team" kinda game.
 Far more is planned but no coders are enlisted to the project at this moment..
 (For more information on the intended scope of VG contact "Morthotos@dd-tech.org")


 How to play VG thus far..  Well to aid you in your hunt you get 2 nice little toys...

 -A Primative Hyper Space drive: (Press * when your batt is full and then start driving).   It will increase your speed by about 75 velocity units. (at least I think so, also I think it boosts your accel rate)

 -You also get an ultra accurate real-time Radar, enabling you to see EVERYTHING from a moons around an orbiting planet, to the shots your opponent fired at you.

 Keys:
 - Tab = toggle focus map center / focus player (default is map center for some reason)
 - Page up and down (not on the keypad) zoom you in and out, (it's a press and press again, not press and hold system, again don't know why.)

 That's it..  The key bindings can be found in Vanguard.ini


 ENJOY!
</pre>

<h3>Melee in solar system</h3>
<pre>
A normal melee fight inside a complete solar system with sun, planets
and moons!

to play it just enter the extended menu and choose
"Melee in solar system (INI)"

the (INI) for those who wonder symbolize that the game come with an
.ini file for you to change!
Through the ini you can change the number of planets, their radius and
more, explanations are added to the ini file.
Enjoy!
