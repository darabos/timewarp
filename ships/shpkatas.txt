Kat Assim

Primary Weapon:
  None at first. Later it is the same as that assimilated from any other ship.
  
Special:
  If the ship is hit while the special fire button is pressed the ship
  assimilates the shot.

Notes:
  The ship assimilates the primary weapon of the ship that hit it even if it was
  hit by the secondary.

  This ship is just an experiment, not intended to be included in the full game.
