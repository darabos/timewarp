Background:

Nautical creatures from a solar system where the sun went nova. They look very much like our extinct ammonites or nautiluses.

Originally this ship was created to capture icy asteroids, which they pulled towards their planet to replenish water supply for thousands of years, until their sun blew itself up, completely incinerating their system. Their population inhabits in a few rather poor colonies in stars close to their home system, from where they witness the slowly fading clouds of their old sun.

How to use this ship:

Special shoots a hook with an elastic band. It has medium range; when it hits an enemy, it grabs hold of the hull, and slows down enemy turn rate a little, permanently. Pressing special slowly brings the prey in; press fire for the final kill with two vicious short lasers. Press special+fire to release the hook.
