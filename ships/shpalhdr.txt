This vessel is relatively slow and cumbersome.
However, the main weapon is powerful and long
ranged, and the side lasers have use as a point
defense system.

fire = Fires a long range torpedo (3 damage,
3 armour). cost of 4 energy.  Each time the
weapon is fired, there is a 'muzzle flash' of
energy that can inflict up to 8 points of
damage at extremely close range.

special = activates the two side lasers.
They start pointing backwards, and rotate
forward as the special button is held down.
The lasers do not auto-target,
so using them as a defense requires careful
timing.
