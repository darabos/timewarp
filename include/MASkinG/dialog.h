	The dialog manager class.
	Dialogs in MASkinG are nothing but widgets that can contain other widgets.
	You should always have one main dialog to which you can add widgets and
	other dialogs. Normally you should derive your own dialog class from Dialog
	and implement some of the virtual functions that define the apearance and
	behaviour of your dialog. In almost all cases you will need to implement
	the HandleEvent() and MsgInitSkin().

	The most common practice to create dialogs is to define widgets as data
	members of their parent dialog and add them to the dialog in the constructor.
	The widgets may of course also be added and removed dynamically. Once the
	dialog is constructed it can be executed with the Execute() function.

	The dialog class should also be used as a baseclass for all compound
	widgets, that is widgets that are made by combining several other more
	low level widgets.
