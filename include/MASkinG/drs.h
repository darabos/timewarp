	The Dirty Rectangle Syste (DRS) screen update driver.
	DRS is similar to normal double buffering except that it doesn't blit the
	entire buffer to the screen every frame but instead keeps a list of rectangles
	that have been chaged since the last update (dirty rectangles) and only
	blits them. This means that when only a small portion of the screen changes
	there is little or no overdaraw which in turn means that for applications where
	most of the screen is static most of the time (like most utility programs,
	editors, etc.) this is by far the fastest screen update method often producing
	thousands of "frames" per second. However when large portions of the screen
	or even the entire screen is updated all the time (like in most games) this
	driver is no faster than regular double buffering. In fact it might even be
	very slightly slower.
