/**
	The Triple Buffering screen update driver.
	Triple buffering is very similar to page flipping. In fact triple buffering
	is just an extension of page flipping where a third video page is used to
	eliminate the need to wait for vertical synchronisation. In a triple buffering
	scheme one page is available for drawing (the active page), one contains the
	last completely drawn frame and is waiting for the next vertical retrace so it
	can be shown on screen and the third contains the previous frame and is at the
	time being drawn by the hardware onto the physical screen. Triple buffering is
	in most cases where the entire screen needs to be fully redrawn the fastest
	screen update method but is not available on all systems.
