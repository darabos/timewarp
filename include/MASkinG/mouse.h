	The mouse input handling class.
	The mouse system is quite simple in MASkinG and there's lots of room for
	optimization. The mouse class hold variables for the current mouse position,
	cursor and the background of the cursor. The user is required to hide the
	mouse before every drawing operation and then show it again when they're
	finished. Actually the dialog manager does this already so you don't really
	need to worry about it. In fact you don't need to know this class even exists
	as the dialog manager either does all work for you or provides its own
	interface for doing things like changing the mouse cursor and so on.
