	functions which provide basic timer functionality at a level just slightly
	above the level of the underlaying Allegro timer functions. It can install
	up to 8 separate timers (more than anyone should ever need), it has wrapper
	functions for the Allegro timer functions and a nice little function for
	checking when a timer has ticked.
