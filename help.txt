Q.  It says "ACK!!! An error occured!  But I don't know what kind!"
or something like that.  What do I do?
A.  I don't know.  

Q.  It says "Game Desynchronized" or something.  What do I do?  
A.  Look in net.txt

Q.  It says "Error: Error switching to graphics mode" or something
like that.  What should I do?  
A.  Use the command line options -res, -bpp, and -fullscreen or
-window to force it to start in a graphics mode your video card
and video driver like.  Example:
"twwin -res 640 480 -bpp 8 -fullscreen -nosound" runs the windows version
of TimeWarp at 640x480 with 8 bits per pixel in a fullscreen mode.  This
is generally a safe setting, although 8 bits per pixel looks ugly.  
Once you get it running, click on options and then select "Set Default" so
that those settings will be the default the next time you run it.  

Note: "twdos -res 320 200 -bpp 8 -fullscreen" will cause TimeWarp 
to run in standard VGA mode (13h).  TimeWarp is actually playable at 
this outdated resolution.  "twdos -res 320 240 -bpp 8 -fullscreen"
should also work on any VGA card.  This can also be usefull if you want
to run twdos on a windows NT dos box that doesn't permit dos programs
to use super VGA mode graphics.
