0.  Star Control: TimeWarp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Star Control TimeWarp is an open source clone/sequel to the epic 
cross-genre game Star Control II.  Currently it includes only a combat
portion, although there are some plans to expand it to include an epic
adventure.  The plot of such an adventure would not have anything to do
with the name "TimeWarp".  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Installing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        tw05u5.zip is a full distribution and requires no other files
(besides pkunzip.exe or a similar program) to install and run.  If it
refuses to run then either you unzipped it wrong, it got corrupted in the
download, I built it wrong, or Allegro doesn't like your computer.  This
includes DOS & windows executables, full source code, minimal documentation,
and data files.  It might also include Linux (X windows) executables, but it 
might not.  
        If it got corrupted in the download, then your unzipper will
probably tell you.  Download this again.  BTW, how are you reading this? :)
        If I screwed up, you can contact me or one of the other developers
using the URL at the top of credits.txt .
