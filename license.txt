This release of Star Control: TimeWarp is public domain, to the
maximum extent possible considering portions of it are derivative 
works of Star Control 1, 2, and 3.

The name "Star Control" is a trademark of Accolade/Infogames,
I think.

The Star Control I & II ships & storyline are copyrighted or 
something by Toys For Bob, more specifically Paul Reiche and
Fred Ford.

The Star Control III ships are copyrighted by Accolade and/or
Legends, I think.  

Anyone is free to use Star Control: TimeWarp for any purpose.  
However, be carefull with the SC 1, 2, & 3 stuff, as these have
extra legal complications due to the extra parties involved.  

Note that the closely associated project SDLTW, the SDL-based version
of TimeWarp, is NOT public domain, nor open-source in the normal sense.  

Star Control 1 was created by Toys For Bob and published by Accolade.  
Star Control 2 was created by Toys For Bob and published by Accolade.  
Star Control 3 was created by Legends(?) and published by Accolade.
