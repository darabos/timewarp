Long Credits:

The Creators
        Fred Ford
        Paul Reiche III
These two wrote Star Control II, which inspired Star Control: TimeWarp.

The Programmers
        orz
        The Fly (founder of the project) (inactive)
        Launchpad
        S.P.Y.
        Marcos (inactive)
        Mr. Sparkle (inactive)
        Richardyzo
        Alstar
orz (that's me) is currently managing the project.  I've written a lot of
  the code, and I integrate other peoples code when they send it to me.  
The Fly did most of the code up until version 0.05, when he joined the
  (Israeli) military (and started a music band?). 
Launchpad wrote all of the Star Control 3 ships, many of the TimeWarp
  original ships, and much of the WussieBot AI. 
S.P.Y. wrote SpyAI, the old gamma correction, the old options menu, and
  some bug-fixes.  
Marcos wrote the smoothing zooming code.  
Mr. Sparkle wrote some bugfixes and some portability stuff.
Richardyzo wrote the Zekfahan (sp?) Shocker.  
Alstar wrote the original Terran Destroyer, though it's been modified since
  by myself and Launchpad.

The Artists (sound & music):
        People I don't know about (inactive)
        Alex Parker
        Launchpad
        Reddish
Um, Launchpad did the sound effects for most of the SC3 & original ships?  
Alex Parker the wrote title screen music for TW.  
Reddish did the victory song for Phylxan.  

The Web Page Managers:
        Atarex
        The Grand Fot
        Starfox
        Alstar
Atarex manages The Pages of Now & Forever, on which TimeWarps web page is
  hosted.  He used to also manage TimeWarps web page.  
The Grand Fot now manages TimeWarps web page.  
I think that Starfox also manages TimeWarps web page?  
Alstar wrote the descriptions of the original ships in TimeWarp that appear
  on the web page.  

The Documentation writters:
        orz
        Launchpad

orz (that's me again) wrote almost all of the .txt files... like this one.  
Launchpad wrote newship.txt, a guide to writting new ships, and wussie.txt, 
  which documents the WussieBot somewhat.  
The old readme (readme.old) was written by Ultron Debugger & The Fly
