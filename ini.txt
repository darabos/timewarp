Ini files used by TimeWarp:

server.ini : server side game settings (physics, gravity, etc.)
client.ini : client side game settings (video, sound, view, etc.)
joys.ini   : joystick calibration settings
fleets.ini : fleets for normal games
scp.ini    : keyboard setup, player setup
tmp.ini    : temporary game initialization data, for the most recent game


How to tweak .ini's for slow computers:

	In game (or in client.ini [Video]), change screen width & height to as low as your video card will go, and change bitsperpixel to 8 (hideously ugly) or 15/16 if in fullscreen mode, or whatever your desktop color mode is if windowed.  
	In client.ini [View]
	change Anti-Aliasing to 0
	change Mip_min to 1 (may help for low-ram computers)
	In server.ini [Game]
	change TicRate to 20 (also helps modem games)
	In server.ini [Stars]
	change Number to 100
	In server.ini [Planet]
	change GravityRange to 10
