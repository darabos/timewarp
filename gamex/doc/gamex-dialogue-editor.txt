DIALOGUE EDITOR
---------------

How:

The dialog basically consists of pieces of text, branching to other pieces of text. Each piece can be either an "alien answer" or an "captain question" in SC2.

Note that often, a alien answer can be followed by several questions of the captain; similarly, a single question by the captain can give different answers based on game settings.

the interface
-------------
Top rect. field: shows the alien info (alien picture).

Top field: shows the text.

Bottom field: shows parts of text of the pieces this text links to.

"P" button: goes to the previous piece of text.

"+" button: adds a new link, (and jumps to that new piece of text ??).

"refresh": reloads the text (only works if you're still within the same piece of text)

checkbox: initial state of the text (is immediately accessible as a dialogue, or hidden until activated by some trigger).

-- todo:

"rem": not supported yet (should delete this piece of text)

triggers (yeah, difficult...) --> perhaps best, a "variable" name, which can change now and then ?
