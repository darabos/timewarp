About the dialog editor...


[caveat: some things aren't supported yet!]

One question is always associated with one answers, therefore I take a Q/A (question/answer) pair as basis.

*Q : the question field. Move the mouse over this field and type the question text.

Note: type "nodelay" if you want the child to be visible immediately without choosing an answer - can be used to change between bitmaps/ characters. One character always takes one screen (for special comments there should be a trigger);

Note: type <<playername>> if you want to insert the player name, or <<shipname>> if you want to insert the ship's name.


* a mark: true is the text is visible by default, false if it needs to be triggered.

* the bitmap choice

*A : the alien answer.

*B : branches. Here you see which questions can be "asked" based on the answer. These questions contain (part of) the text of that dialogue record's question. If you left-click on one of them, the content of this dialogue is temp-saved, and the child dialogue is opened.

*+ : create a new branch. The old dialogue is temp-saved, and you jump to a new record.

*<P : jump back. The other dialogue is temp-saved.

*refresh: use this button to revert to temp-saved data, overwriting all that you've typed so far for the active record.

Esc: stop. The dialogues are permanently saved on disk.
Note: if the program crashes before you press Esc, you lose all data.


ctrl+V = insert text from the clipboard. There's only this paste function (no copy).
