	   How to compile and run TimeWarp under Linux/Unix


About this file
    
    The insructions here were only tested under Linux, but should work on 
    every unix without or with few modifications. You can find additional 
    about TW under Linux info at:
    http://www.linux-games.com/timewarp/
    If you have any problems and/or suggestions concerning the compilation
    process, don't hesitate to write me a mail (karlb@gmx.net). 
    

1. Installing Allegro:

    If you already have Allegro installed you can proceed with part 2.
    If not, then get the recent Allegro beta from:
    http://alleg.sourceforge.net/allegro/wip.html
    To compile and install, untar Allegro and cd into Allegro dir.
    Then type the following commands:
    $ sh fixunix.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make depend
    $ make
    $ su -c "make install"

	    
2. Installing jgmod (optional) 

    If you want music, you'll have to get jgmod from
    http://www.geocities.com/jeffery_guan/jgmod/jgmod.zip
    Unzip the jgmod.zip and execute:
    $ sh fixunix.sh
    $ make
    $ su -c "make install"


3. Installing TW 

    It looks like you already got and extracted the TW zip. So let's set the 
    right permissions for the executable files (they got lost because zips 
    don't support file permissions):
    $ chmod a+x config.status configure install-sh mkinstalldirs update.sh
    
    Now let's compile TW:
    $ ./configure && make
    
    That's it! Run ./timewarp and have fun!


4. Updating TW    
    
    Of course you can simply download the newest TW version. But that's
    a huge download. You could also download the newest patch. But there's
    a much better way! If you have rsync installed, you can simply run
    the update.sh file delivered with TW.
