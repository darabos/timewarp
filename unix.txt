What do I need to do to get Star Control: TimeWarp running on unix?


Note: Running TimeWarp remotely (using X-windows, or anything else for
that matter) is NOT recommended.  Performance will suck terribly, and
I've seen older versions of Allegro mis-autodetect such circumstances
and crash.


twmake.rar contains the autoconf / makefile / whatever stuff for TimeWarp,
if you like that stuff.  They're placed inside of a .tar since they include
files with names that are not valid on DOS.  I think the build process using
those is something like "./configure ; make", but I don't use unix regularly
and can't quite recall.  


However, I do use gcc regularly, and this is how you use gcc to build TW
on unix manually, using g++:

1.  Install a recent beta of Allegro, which you can find here:
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/allegro/wip.html
The instructions can be found in allegros files readme.txt and readme.uni

2.  Unzip TimeWarps .zip file into a new directory where-ever you
feel like.  I (and TimeWarp) am not familiar with the directory
structure conventions common to unix.  TW will need write access to 
it's own directory, and may have problems when used by multiple 
users simultaneously.  Also, DO NOT use the -a option when unzipping, this
seems to corrupt TWs code somehow.  

3.  If you're feeling industrious, download and compile the JGMOD 
library described in djgpp.txt.  Otherwise, edit source/libs.h and
uncomment the line "//#define NO_JGMOD".  This will remove music.
Note: JGMOD may not work properly on multi-processor computers.  

4.  Switch to the source directory.
If you are using JGMOD (necessary for music), type this stuff:
(please note that those are backtics ` not single-quotes ' )

g++ -c *.cpp util/*.cpp -O2 -DNO_JGMOD
gcc -c util/*.c -O2
g++ -c ais/*.cpp melee/*.cpp games/*.cpp other/*.cpp -O2
g++ -c sc1ships/*.cpp sc2ships/*.cpp sc3ships/*.cpp newships/*.cpp -O2
g++ -o ../twlinux *.o -ljgmod `allegro-config --libs`

If you are not using JGMOD, type this stuff:

g++ -c *.cpp util/*.cpp -O2 -DNO_JGMOD
gcc -c util/*.c -O2
g++ -c ais/*.cpp melee/*.cpp games/*.cpp other/*.cpp -O2
g++ -c sc1ships/*.cpp sc2ships/*.cpp sc3ships/*.cpp newships/*.cpp -O2
g++ -o ../twlinux *.o `allegro-config --libs`


5.  If you compile TW for a platform other than windows, DOS, linux, or 
BeOS, let me know about it.  So far TW has been tried on windows, DOS, 
linux, BeOS, and a beta of OS X, but it failed on the OS X beta.
