===< What is the TimeWarp Project? >===

Once upon a time there were Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III, who created two
epic games of the Star Control saga: the first one, and the second one,
which became the greatest game in the quadrant. They were working for a
little company called Accolade. Then their games succeeded and Accolade
became a big company. That is, a BIG company. (please excuse us for any
"minor" historical errors in this document)

They lived happily ever after, until Accolade were tricked by the Umgah to
dump Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III, and make their own third sequel to the
series which had absolutely nothing to do with the previous ones, and shamed
the honorable title of Star Control, which had resonated deeply into the
hearts of each and every one of us. The Umgah told Accolade this would make
it a better game. It is uncertain how they managed to make them buy that
crap, but it is believed the Dnyarri had something to do with it. Anyway...

We, the loyal followers and believers in the path set by the ancient ones,
have vowed to restore the true name of Star Control, and cleanse the shame
caused by Accolade's sequel. However, we do not seek to harm our beloved
brothers in Accolade or to dishonor them by doing this. Therefore, we shall
make this sequel available to all who wish to download it and have the
bandwidth.

We hope we will achieve these goals, and create a sequel that will match,
and IF possible, accede the level of sarcastic humor, witty dialog, and
overall challenge of Star Control II.

===< What is Star CoNETrol? >===

Rome wasn't built in a day, as they say, and neither was the Star Control
saga. First, we want to build a melee game with all the ships and features
of Star Control 1 & 2 included in it. The main new feature in our version
will be multi-player network *dancing*, supporting up to at least four
*campers* simultaneously. But, we want to keep everybody up to date with our
progress, which could help promote additional support for the project.
Therefore, we are releasing these early versions which aren't fully featured
as yet. They may also have bugs. If they do, report them to us and we will
stomp them. There are a couple of bugs we are aware of already, so there's
no need to report them. (See bugs.txt for known bugs and "quirks") As for the
question "why did you release a version with bugs you knew were there?" we
answer that these are alpha versions, so they can crash your computer and
format your hard disk for all we care until we release a full version. And
even then we won't care, because we take absolutely no responsability for
any damage downloading, activating and/or otherwise abusing this package may
cause to your computer, or your health. (See "legal stuff")

Star CoNETrol is programmed in C++, using Object Oriented Programming. It is
compiled using DJGPP DOS compiler, together with PGCC which supports Pentium
optimization. We use the Allegro Game Library and PPCOL add-on to Allegro
for graphics and SFX, and the JGMOD library for music. For keyboard handling
which is a bit more advanced than Allegro's, we use LIBKB.

===< What makes it tick? >===

From this day forth, we shall release the source code along with the binary
executables and data. This will probably make many curious people very happy
and hopefully save us some explanatory hassle. Just remember where it came
from. We reserve the right over any further official TimeWarp releases based
on this source code. After all, we did build it. You can of course do
whatever you want with the source code, but please remember to give us the
proper credit in any releases you make based upon it.

Remember that in order to compile the source code in it's current 32-bit DOS
platform format, you need to have DJGPP v2.01 compiler and the following
freeware open-source libraries installed:
 * Allegro Game Library v3.11
 * PPCol collision detection library add-on to Allegro v1.4
 * JGMOD MOD/S3M/XM playing library v0.94
 * LibKB keyboard library v1.00

You also need to install the Pentium compiler (PGCC) to compile the source
code for Pentium machines. To change the default setting in the makefile to
compile for 486 instead of Pentium machines comment out "PGCC=1".

If you don't know where to find DJGPP and these excellent game programming
libraries, here's a good place to start looking for them:

  http://www.delorie.com

===< System Requirements >===

The current version requires:
  * Intel Pentium-100MHz CPU or compatible:
    The current version is optimized for Pentium CPUs, though it should run
    on slower CPUs, but hasn't been tested. If it runs for you reasonably
    well on a 486 or even less, you can recompile it for 486. Just remember
    you need to compile the libraries for 486 machines as well.
  * SVGA graphics card supporting 640x480 resolution:
    Support has been added for 8-bit and 15-bit color, as well as 16-bit
    color mode. However, the time required to load the data in color modes
    other than 16-bit color grows subtantialy, since the image data must be
    converted. This is especially apparent in 8-bit color mode, and the
    result doesn't look so pretty... but if you have problems with your
    display, and have no choice, you'll just have to sit tight and wait for
    it to load.
  * Sound card HIGHLY recommended, for music and SFX.
  * About ten megabytes of hard disk space. (with all ship data)
  * M$ Ultron 95 (also known as Microsoft Windows 95) - for network support
    in future releases, currently runs under M$-DOS as well.
  * We THINK it will work on a machine with 8MB RAM, or perhaps less, but
    this hasn't been tested.

===< Game Controls >===

All twenty-five Star Control 1 and 2 ships are now fully implemented, fully
featured, and 3D rendered, with various "quirks" here and there: (See
bugs.txt)

 * Androsynth Guardian
 * Arilou Skiff
 * Chenjesu Broodhome
 * Chmmr Avatar
 * Druuge Mauler
 * Earthling Cruiser
 * Ilwrath Avenger
 * Kohr-Ah Marauder
 * Kzer-Za Dreadnought
 * Melnorme Trader
 * Mmrnmhrm X-Form
 * Mycon Podship
 * Orz Nemesis
 * Pkunk Fury
 * Shofixti Scout
 * Slylandro Probe
 * Spathi Eluder
 * Supox Blade
 * Syreen Penetrator
 * Thraddash Torch
 * Umgah Drone
 * Utwig Jugger
 * Yehat Terminator
 * Vux Intruder
 * Zoq-Fot-Pik Stinger

A fleet selection menu has been added to build fleets for continuos battle.
All the default fleets from Star Control 2 are included, in addition to a new
fleet consisting of all the above ships. The maximum fleet size is currently
fifty ships, as opposed to fourteen ships in Star Control 2.

Keyboard controls for thrusting, turning left, turning right, firing weapon
and special ability are configurable with our built-in bronze-age technology
user-hostile advanced keyboard setup interface. If something in the game
makes you want to puke you can always run for your life with the "Escape"
key. Please avoid using the function keys (F1 through F12) in your key
configuration, since they are reserved for any special features we may decide
to implement in future versions.

During melee, you can activate and deactivate a "meter" which measures and
displays how many frames are animated each second, using the F12 key. We
would appreciate it if you could send us an e-mail and tell us the range of
these values on your system, and what system you are running it on. This is
especially encouraged if you have a bug we don't know of to report. (Please
read bugs.txt before reporting any bugs)

The "PlayMusic" setting is made active and inactive by setting it's
corresponding value in scp.ini to one and zero, respectively. Thus, placing

  PlayMusic = 1

turns this setting on, and placing

  PlayMusic = 0

turns this setting off. Turning "PlayMusic" off mutes music during melee,
(you can unmute it and remute it with F1) leaving only sound effects, and
turns off the interface music altogether. This setting was designed mainly
for those instances when you've heard the melee music a million times too
much, and would like to listen to some Pink Floyd while you're blasting the
guts out of your opponent. (or programming the game)

16-bit color mode is selected by default, but you can select 8-bit color, or
15-bit color mode by modifying the "BitsPerPixel" setting in the "SCP"
section. Entering values other than 8 or 15 will result in selection of
16-bit color. You can enter 1, 2, 4, 24, 32, 92143785397 or any other
combination you like, but the mode selected would still be 16-bit color,
unless you select 8 or 15.
