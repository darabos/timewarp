Star Control: TimeWarp on BeOS

Since BeOS is no longer installed on my computer, 
the latest versions of TimeWarp have not been compiled 
for BeOS.  

However, older versions of TimeWarp are known to work 
on BeOS, and there haven't been any significant platform 
changes, so newer versions should also work there.  

Furthermore, the BeOS version of Allegro (a library used 
by TimeWarp) has matured substancially with Allegro version 
4.0.0, so a new build of TimeWarp for BeOS should work much 
better than the old ones.  

The last time I built TimeWarp for BeOS, everything compiled 
and ran, but TimeWarp would crash after aproximately 10 
minutes, and sound & music were unreliable.
