In theory, allegrotw should compile just about anywhere Allegro compiles.
In theory anyway.

Portability:
criteria                status


simple C                no (requires C++ compiler)

simple C++              yes (no templates, but uses zero-sized arrays
                        post-pended on structd (non-standard but works on
                        most compilers))

instruction set         any (only IA32 tested)

OS portable             yes

Required Libraries      Allegro 4

Recommended Libraries   JGMOD

endian portable         yes (only little-endian tested)

misalignment portable   yes (not tested)

integer size            32 bit works, 64 might (doubtful), 16 won't

pointer size            32 bit works, 64 should work
