TimeWarp can be built with Microsoft Visual C++.

You should make a project of type "Win32 Application".

You should link it to Allegro (alld.lib for debuging, alleg.lib for normal
builds), optionally to JGMOD for musc (libjgmod.lib), and to wsock32.lib
and winmm.lib .  

The webpages for those libraries:
Allegro: http://alleg.sourceforge.net/allegro/
JGMOD: http://www.geocities.com/jeffery_guan/jgmod/jgmod.html
wsock32.lib comes with MSVC
winmm.lib comes with MSVC

Make sure to get a recent version of Allegro (3.9.36 at the time of this
writting), not 3.12.

Also, if you plan to do development, it might be a good idea to compile
JGMOD in debugging mode; I don't know much about it, but it's been
said that a bug in MSVCs optimizers causes JGMOD to act strangely when
loading certain file formats.
