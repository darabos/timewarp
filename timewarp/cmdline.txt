TimeWarp Command Line Options:

-res x y
Set screen resolution to x by y.  
Example: -res 512 384

-bpp z
Set screen color depth to z (valid options are 8, 15, 16, 24, or 32
Example: -bpp 8

-interpolate_frames
Causes TW to interpolate new frames of animation between frames 
of physics.  This improves graphical quality when running at low 
tic-rates.  When this option is enabled, TW will use 100% of 
available CPU-time.  

-auto_unload
Causes TW to automatically unload datafiles as soon as 
possible.  This will use less RAM, but have more delays.  

-low_quality
Not Yet Implemented
Causes TW to use lower quality graphics.  This will use less 
RAM.  

-play game mode
Bypasses the main menu, putting you directly into a game.  
Note that names are case-sensitive, and that underscores (_)
should be used in place of spaces in game names.  
Example: -play Melee_in_Asteroid_Field Normal

-fullscreen
Set screen mode to fullscreen.  This is the opposite of -window

-window
Set screen mode to windowed.  This is the opposite of -fullscreen

-nosound
Disables sound support.  

-nojoystick
Disables joystick support

-nomouse
Disables mouse support

-nokeyboard
Disables keyboard support (a bad idea...)

-noidle
When this option is enabled, TW will attempt to use 100% of available 
CPU time.  Generally, using the -interpolate_frames option is more 
useful, but this option may be useful in working around possible 
hardware bugs or TW bugs.  

Notes:

1.  x & y do not have to match a normal resolution; you can
use combinations of x, y that don't show up in the normal screen
selection.  For instance, to run twdos.exe in VGA mode 13, you
would type "twdos.exe -res 320 200 -bpp 8".
Also, strange Mode-X modes are allowed on platforms where you have
direct hardware access (DOS, unix w/ root), allowing resolutions like
these: 256x256, 320x240, 360x240, etc.
