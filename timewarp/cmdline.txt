TimeWarp Command Line Options:

-res x y
Set screen resolution to x by y.  
Example: -res 512 384

-bpp z
Set screen color depth to z (valid options are 8, 15, 16, 24, or 32
Example: -bpp 8

-low_quality
Not Yet Implemented
Causes TW to use lower quality graphics.  This will use less 
RAM.  

-play game gametype
-play demo demofile
-play net1client serverIP [port]
-play net1server gametype [port]
Bypasses the main menu, putting you directly into a game.  
Note that game names are case-sensitive, and that underscores (_)
should be used in place of spaces.
The 'type' parameter must be either 'game', 'demo', 'net1client',
or 'net1server'.  If the port parameter is omitted then it will
default to port 15515, as specified in client.ini.  
Example: -play game Melee
Example: -play game Melee_in_Asteroid_Field
Example: -play demo mydemo.dmo
Example: -play net1client 131.215.72.49
Example: -play net1server Melee_in_Asteroid_Field 15515
Example: -play net1client josh.joshesdomain.net 15515

-fullscreen
Set screen mode to fullscreen.  This is the opposite of -window

-window
Set screen mode to windowed.  This is the opposite of -fullscreen

-nosound
Disables sound support.  

-nojoystick
Disables joystick support

-nomouse
Disables mouse support

-nokeyboard
Disables keyboard support (a bad idea...)

-noidle
When this option is enabled, TW will attempt to use 100% of available 
CPU time.  Generally, using the -interpolate_frames option is more 
useful, but this option may be useful in working around possible 
hardware bugs or TW bugs.  

Notes:

1.  x & y do not have to match a normal resolution; you can
use combinations of x, y that don't show up in the normal screen
selection.  For instance, to run twdos.exe in VGA mode 13, you
would type "twdos.exe -res 320 200 -bpp 8".
Also, strange Mode-X modes are allowed on platforms where you have
direct hardware access (DOS, unix w/ root), allowing resolutions like
these: 256x256, 320x240, 360x240, etc.
