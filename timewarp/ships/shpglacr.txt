This is a slow, but potentially very dangerous cruiser.  The main gun fires
a spread of five high damage unguided torpedoes that are all but immune to
point defense systems.  The rear firing weapon compensates somewhat for the
sluggish maneuvering.

fire = torpedo spread (5 x 2 point warheads) cost 10 power.  2 damage each, 
4 armour each
special = fires a single rear torpedo, cost 2 power. 2 damage, 4 armour
