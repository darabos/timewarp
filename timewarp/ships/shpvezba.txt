Vezlagari Battle Barge.

This ship is a converted freighter.  The weaponry is made as an
exact copy of the weaponry of a much older, extinct race.  However,
the Vezlagari do not understand how to give targeting instructions
to these otherwise very effective weapons.  Therefore, all
missile launches and laser fire is in a random trajectory.

fire = launches one corkscrew missile.  Cost is 2 battery, damage of 6,
armour 3.  The missiles will randomly launch forward or backward, and will
meander across space in an unpredictable fashion.  Scoring a hit with
one is difficult, but worth the effort.

special = projects energy beam.  The cost is three battery, damage
is one or two points of damage.  The facing, duration, damage,
 and length of the beam is completely random.
