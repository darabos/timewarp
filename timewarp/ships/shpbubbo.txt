 Secondary - Long range heavy missile. (EMP Slug)

Extra - Absorbing Shield
 Reduce damage by two and converts kinetic energy from
 damage into a battery reserve.

 EMP Slug deals two points of direct damage every successful contact and hurls
 opponent 180 degrees from point of impact.

 33% chances of blowing up when killed, injuring anything near by (radius of 10).

Weaknesses
 High battery consumption for both primary and secondary weapons.
 Flanking moves by agile fighters.
 Missiles can collide in its own ship.
 Low crew complement.
 
Strenghts
 Powerful against big but slow ships using EMP slug to gain valuable time to gain distance and/or
 to simply wear-off opponent (assuming opponent isn't Doog).
 Dual exit point missile launchers (can shoot both in front and rear).
 Light missiles will readily attack any "specials" by opponent ship once reaching
 a certain proximity (radius of 10).
