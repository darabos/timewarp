Kabo Weakener,

This ship has the shape of some wild flower,

The main is a short-range shooter, doing 1 d,

The special is formed by long-range homing mines. When a ship hits them, they
disintegrate and the powdery remains form a green haze around the ship.
These cause additional damage to any damage taken.
