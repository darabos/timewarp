Once upon a time there were Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III, who created two
epic games of the Star Control saga: the first one, and the second one,
which became the greatest game in the quadrant. They were working for a
little company called Accolade. Then their games succeeded and Accolade
became a big company. That is, a BIG company. (please excuse us for any
"minor" historical errors in this document)

They lived happily ever after, until Accolade were tricked by the Umgah to
dump Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III, and make their own third sequel to the
series which had absolutely nothing to do with the previous ones, and shamed
the honorable title of Star Control, which had resonated deeply into the
hearts of each and every one of us. The Umgah told Accolade this would make
it a better game. It is uncertain how they managed to make them buy that
crap, but it is believed the Dnyarri had something to do with it. Anyway...

We, the loyal followers and believers in the path set by the ancient ones,
have vowed to restore the true name of Star Control, and cleanse the shame
caused by Accolade's sequel. However, we do not seek to harm our beloved
brothers in Accolade or to dishonor them by doing this. Therefore, we shall
make this sequel available to all who wish to download it and have the
bandwidth.

We hope we will achieve these goals, and create a sequel that will match,
and IF possible, accede the level of sarcastic humor, witty dialog, and
overall challenge of Star Control II.

<h2><center>BUG REPORTS</center></h2>
<p>
</p>

<p>
Only beta release exist now. First, it means that if you play the game you're an beta tester.  Be proud.  Second, it means that the
game is likely to crash with great frequency.  Upon finding a problem,
we'd like you to report it, but before you do, please do the following:

<ul>
  <li> Try to isolate what causes it: "Crashes with a null dereference
  about half the time when firing and taunting with a Pkunk" is better
  than "Melee doesn't work."  If the game crashes, notice what error
  is produced. </li>

  <li>Go to the bug database <a	href="http://bugs.cs.iupui.edu/cgi-bin/bugzilla/">TimeWarp Bugzilla</a>
  and post a report of the problem there. Search the database first if
  it has been already posted; if we get many duplicate reports, processing
  them eats our time from actual development. If it's been reported, and
  you have more information, feel free to confirm that you've reproduced it
  by adding a comment to the report. If ten people have already confirmed it,
  though, it's probably best to treat it as duly reported.</li>

  <li> In the case of a crash, a stack trace can be very helpful for us too.
  If you don't know what a stack trace is, don't worry about it.</li>

  <li>If your issue is more like "support request" than bug report and you
  want help from other users, then posting it to our forum might be
  more appropriate:<a href="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~timewarp/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi">TimeWarp Forum</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><center>GAME TYPES</center></h2>
<div class="title"><center>GOB</center></div> 
<p>
</p>


<ul>
  <li><b>What is Gob?</b><br>
    <p>
	Gob is like a cross between Asteroids, Life-Force, and Star Control.
    It's the game of survival with custom ship upgrades and simple quests.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>How do I start Gob?</b><br>
    <p>
    Run twwin.exe or timewarp. Click on the "Extended Menu" button.  Click on the "Play Game" button.
    Click on the "Gob" button.  
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>What is the goal of Gob?</b><br>
  <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid dieing.</li>
      <li>Try to get as bad-ass a ship as you can.</li>
      <li>Kill lots of enemies.</li>
      <li>Complite quests</li>
    </ul>
   <p>
If you survive for long enough and accumulate enough wealth, you will
eventually be able to purchase the "Hyper Dynamo" upgrade.  Once you
get that, you can basically consider yourself to have won the game.
Try to win Gob with as many different ships as you can.  
  </p>
  <li><b>What are the controls in Gob?</b><br>
  <p>
  The keyboard controls for config 0 in TimeWarp
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>What can I do in Gob?</b><br>
  <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can fly around in a really big map (MUCH larger than a normal melee).</li>
      <li>You can kill enemy ships.  They appear randomly.</li>
      <li>You can visit space stations.  They orbit planets.</li>
      <li>Complite various quests</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>What can I do at space stations?</b><br>
  <p></p>
    <ul>
       <li>You can buy upgrades for your ship.</li>
       <li>You can buy a new ship.  You automatically sell your old ship when you do so.</li>
       <li>You can repair your ship.</li>
       <li>You can speak with commander.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>What starbases are there?  What are the differences between them?</b><br>
  <p>
     There are 4 starbases of 4 types (though there are only 3 different
     starbase graphics... 
     They are located at random locations, except for one which starts out next 
     to you, at 12000x12000. Each type of starbase sells a specific type of ship, 
     either Supox, Orz, Kohr-Ah, or Utwig. Some starbases may also sell unique upgrades only available there.  
  </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>What upgrades are available.</b><br>
  <p>
     There are a number of generic upgrades that are available for most
     types of ships.  
  </p>
  <p>
     Each purchasable ship type has a number of ship specific upgrades
     available for it, including at least one special ship specific upgrade.  
     Most special ship specific upgrades can only be purchased once.
  </p>
  <p>
     There are also a number of very special upgrades.  These can
     usually be purchased for any ship type, but only at certain
     starbases.  Most of these are very expensive.  Some can only be
     purchased when certain conditions are met.  
  </p>
  <p>
     Most upgrades are lost when your ship is sold (although they add
     to the sale value of your ship).  
  </p>
  <p>

</li>
<li><b>What is the difficulty of the enemies based upon?  And the cost of the upgrades?</b><br>

<p>
The type and frequency of enemy spawning is based upon the time you have
been alive and the number of enemies currently alive.  The cost of the
upgrades is based upon what upgrades you already have, and upon what type
of ship you have.
