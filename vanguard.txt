 Presently Vanguard (VG) is just a "Hunt down the enemy team" kinda game. 
 Far more is planned but no coders are enlisted to the project at this moment..   
 (For more information on the intended scope of VG contact "Morthotos@dd-tech.org") 
  
  
 How to play VG thus far..  Well to aid you in your hunt you get 2 nice little toys... 
  
 -A Primative Hyper Space drive: (Press * when your batt is full and then start driving).   It will increase your speed by about 75 velocity units. (at least I think so, also I think it boosts your accel rate) 
  
 -You also get an ultra accurate real-time Radar, enabling you to see EVERYTHING from a moons around an orbiting planet, to the shots your opponent fired at you.   
  
 Keys:  
 - Tab = toggle focus map center / focus player (default is map center for some reason) 
 - Page up and down (not on the keypad) zoom you in and out, (it's a press and press again, not press and hold system, again don't know why.) 
  
 That's it..  The key bindings can be found in Vanguard.ini 
  
  
 ENJOY!
